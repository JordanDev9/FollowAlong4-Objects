// SECTION A — FOLLOW ALONG: type the code from the video (or the guide) in this class.
//    His class is called Main. Yours is called OverloadedConstructors.
//    Leave the "package part17;" line and the class line alone. Type everything else yourself.
//    You also make a new class called Pizza. The README shows how.
//
// SECTION B — COMMENTS: when you finish, put a // comment ABOVE every line of code,
//    saying in YOUR OWN WORDS what that line does. Do this in Pizza.java too.
